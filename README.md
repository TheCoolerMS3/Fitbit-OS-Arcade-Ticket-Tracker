# Build instructions
Use the Fitbit OS Simulator if you do not own a Fitbit OS device: [Windows/Wine](https://simulator-updates.fitbit.com/download/stable/win/) [MacOS](https://simulator-updates.fitbit.com/download/stable/mac). Ensure you are simulating a Fitbit OS 5 device (Versa 3 or Sense).

Follow [Fitbit's documentation instructions](https://dev.fitbit.com/getting-started/) to get a Fitbit SDK environment working, make sure your developer bridge is enabled (This is done automatically in the Fitbit OS Simulator), then entering the command "bi" in the SDK.

# Compatibility
I built this app for Fitbit OS 5 since I used to own a Fitbit Sense and it's most familiar to me. This meaning it supports the:
* Fitbit Sense
* Fitbit Versa 3

I've also had success building for SDK 7 based devices, which are:
* Fitbit Sense 2
* Fitbit Versa 4

However, I cannot submit that build to the Fitbit App Gallery as they refuse to accept apps for those devices (I tried :( )

Fitbit OS 4 (Ionic, Versa, Versa Lite, Versa 2) and WearOS (Pixel Watch, Pixel Watch 2, others) support may be worked on at a later date.
