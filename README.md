# Fitbit OS Arcade Ticket Tracker
 Tracks hack club Arcade tickets on Fitbit OS 5.
 
# Build instructions
Follow [Fitbit's document instructions](https://dev.fitbit.com/getting-started/) to get a Fitbit SDK environment working, make sure your developer bridge is enabled (This is done automatically in the Fitbit OS Simulator, and can be done by making sure you are logged into an account with developer options enabled and that your watch has a WiFi connection in the Fitbit mobile app, syncing, and enabling it in settings.), then entering the command "bi" in the SDK.

# Compatibility
I built this app for Fitbit OS 5 since I used to own a Fitbit Sense and it's most familiar to me. Fitbit OS 4 (Ionic, Versa, Versa Lite, Versa 2), Fitbit OS '6' (Versa 4, Sense 2) and WearOS (Pixel Watch, Pixel Watch 2, others) support may be worked on at a later date.
